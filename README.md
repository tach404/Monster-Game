DO NOT SUBMIT THIS FOR COURSEWORK.
Apart from that you are free to download it and play around with the game.

I plan on coming back to this when I'm not working on more exciting stuff. I Also plan to add some movement functionality to the monsters, the can be a little static without any movement on the board.
