# HOW TO PLAY
Add monsters to the board, monsters can attack other monsters that are one space next to it.
Board size can be changed for a different type of play.

I plan on coming back to this when I'm not working on more exciting stuff. I Also plan to add some movement functionality to the monsters, the can be a little static without any movement on the board.
